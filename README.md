# Wearable_reliability

This is data generated during the study reported in the paper On the reliability of wearable technology: A tutorial on measuring heart rate and heart rate variability in the wild"
The two sheets in this dataset present:
(1) (Biometric_raw_data) Raw biometric data as recorded by Biostrap wristband, with participant number, date and time of the recording
(2) (Aggregated_biometrics_with_mood) Aggregated biometric and subjective mood data, per participant per day. Raw data was cleaned, as described in the paper, and averaged. Subjective mood data is presented for the current and previous day (yesterday).
BPM = beats per minute, a measure of heart rate
HRV = root mean square difference between successive heartbeats, a measure of heart rate variability
